# Copy of Basic Blocks

> ⚠️ [Narkdown](https://github.com/younho9/narkdown) is a tool to use Notion as a Markdown editor.
> So [Narkdown](https://github.com/younho9/narkdown) Does not support all features that Notion has.

## Headings `Support`

> ☝ Notion has a title for the page, but it only supports headings up to step 3. On the other hand, GFM supports headings up to six steps. Therefore, when exporting a Notion page, you can use the title of the page as heading 1 and lower the rest by one level to support a total of four levels of heading.
> Also, remember that each page usually has only one title(heading 1).

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

## Divider `Support`

> ☝ In [GFM](https://github.github.com/gfm/), the divider is automatically rendered after header 1 and 2, so the divider after the header is not added.

## Divider after Heading 2

### Divider after the other
